patients based on covariate information: Application to
prostate cancer", Bulletin Cancer, Paris, 67:477-488, 1980.

These data were from a randomized trial comparing four treatments
for state 3 and 4 prostate cancer, with almost equal numbers of
patients on placebo and each of three doses of estrogen.

Four patients had missing values on all of the following
variables: wt, pf, hx, sbp, dpb, ekg, hg, bm; two of these
patients were also missing sz.  These patients are excluded
from consideration.

The ultimate goal of an analysis of the dataset might be to
discover patterns in survival or to do an analysis of
covariance to assess the effect of treatment while adjusting
for patient heterogeneity.
